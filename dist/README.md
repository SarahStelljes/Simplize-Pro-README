# DragonArc
  ## Description
  I wanted a program that would help with organizing story ideas, events in a story outline, character sheets for a story, and all that is required for a story so I could easily write a good story of my own.. DragonArc was meant to help not only me, but others as well with their own stories so it will help create ones vision of a good story.. DragonArc solves the problem of keeping one's story information organized.. How to use a NPM Package called Tauri, and a learned a little bit about the programing language called Rust. Not only that, but it helped me realize that even though it was made with HTML, CSS, and JS, to make a GUI for a computer program (Tauri translates HTML, CSS, and JS into Rust, which is made to help with making computer programs), you cannot use FS. It seems like common sense, but I had temporarily forgotten that you cannot accesss a file system of a computer via websites, which is essentially what I was doing..
